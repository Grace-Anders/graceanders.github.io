                I am a recent college graduate with honors, holding a double minor in Fine Art and Creative Writing alongside my Major in Computer Science. 
                Creative outlets are essential to me, and I spend my time bringing ideas to life through mediums of code, writing, and art in many forms. 
                Growing up, creative fields were where I thrived, and I hadn't considered programming until high school, when it clicked. Programming, too, 
                is a creative medium with endless potential. Throughout college, I worked hard, was hired as a tutor in my sophomore year, and often juggled 
                two to three jobs on top of full-time school, not only surviving but thriving under the pressure. After graduation, I am eager to continue 
                exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, seeking opportunities to innovate and make a positive impact in the tech industry. 
                I am passionate about using my diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges and contribute to meaningful projects that inspire and empower others.

                In my free time, I enjoy keeping up with my creative hobbies, hosting get-togethers with friends, and caring for my dog, 
            Oliver. I tackle each hurdle and new opportunity head-on, constantly challenging myself and seeking a better life. 
            Regular gym visits and prioritizing mental health are crucial to my routine. In both my personal life and projects,
