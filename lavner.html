                At Lavner Education, I taught programming and game design to learners aged 7 to 14, using platforms like Game Maker 
                and Scratch. Working full-time at a tech-based summer camp, I handled class sizes ranging from 3 to 15 students. 
                My responsibilities included debugging code, maintaining classroom order, and providing continuous technical 
                and emotional support. I also curated lesson plans, adapting them to meet the unique needs of each class 
                to ensure engaging and effective learning experiences. This role required me to manage classroom behavior, 
                set expectations, and offer one-on-one lessons before and after class if requested, fostering a supportive 
                and productive learning environment.

                As a Scratch instructor for Lavner Education, I taught programming to children aged 7-8, introducing them to 
                problem-solving and creative thinking. My role involved fostering their imagination, creating a safe learning 
                environment, and managing a class of varying expertise levels. By curating lesson plans and adapting to each 
                student’s needs, I ensured every child felt supported and challenged appropriately. This experience taught me 
                the complexities of teaching young learners and how to push those capable while aiding those who struggled. 
                It highlighted the importance of care and dedication in boosting students' confidence and abilities.

                At Lavner Education, I taught programming and game design to learners aged 7 to 14, using platforms like Game Maker 
                and Scratch. Working full-time at a tech-based summer camp, I handled class sizes ranging from 3 to 15 students. 
                My responsibilities included debugging code, maintaining classroom order, and providing continuous technical 
                and emotional support. I also curated lesson plans, adapting them to meet the unique needs of each class 
                to ensure engaging and effective learning experiences. This role required me to manage classroom behavior, 
                set expectations, and offer one-on-one lessons before and after class if requested, fostering a supportive 
                and productive learning environment.

                As a Scratch instructor for Lavner Education, I taught programming to children aged 7-8, introducing them to 
                problem-solving and creative thinking. My role involved fostering their imagination, creating a safe learning 
                environment, and managing a class of varying expertise levels. By curating lesson plans and adapting to each 
                student’s needs, I ensured every child felt supported and challenged appropriately. This experience taught me 
                the complexities of teaching young learners and how to push those capable while aiding those who struggled. 
                It highlighted the importance of care and dedication in boosting students' confidence and abilities.

            In my Game Maker classes at Lavner Education, I taught game design to students aged 9-14, managing a class of 15. 
            I shared my expertise to guide students towards rewarding creative work, emphasizing engagement and active listening. 
            Flexibility and attentiveness to students' interests were crucial for effective learning. This experience taught me to foster 
            creativity and excitement positively while preventing burnout. Leading a larger group helped me understand the balance between 
            independence and providing necessary support.
